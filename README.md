# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind creating this was to be a reference for things I might forget and/or use often enough to get me started. I wanted to push a little beyond the basics of what was given. There's still plenty of holes. There's still other things that could be added and could be formatted better. I think the biggest thing that I'm learning is that you can't memorize everything, so having some quick reference documentation in one place could be helpful. 

## Installation

No installation. This will be deployed to Github Pages.

## Usage

The usage of the guide is to provide very basic concepts as a place to start with web development and references for various documentation that was new, different, or simply necessary to complete some of the tasks. If one takes a look at the console (If you're using Chrome, this will be Ctrl + Shift + J on Windows, Cmd + Option + J on a Mac), there's a brief JS script that will some of the topics and then randomly selects one for study.
